                <i className='text-lg'>LMS started as my practice project when I joined Tinasoft for my intership. Luckily, my mentor found me potential,
                    then he taught me which to start, where to learn and who to study. Therefore, my skills were improved day by day.
                    LMS has been built by all of dedications and hard-work, please enjoy your experience here.
